       <h3>Ring of Fire</h3>
       <section class="home">
        <p>This vast and unique area is perhaps the most spectacular part of the Ring of Fire that encircles most of the Pacific Ocean. It has many secrets to yield and many potentially valuable lessons that can benefit the rest of the world. NOAA research expeditions will continue to lead comprehensive oceanographic and ecological surveys of coral reefs in the Islands Unit.</p>

        <p>Extreme pressure and heat, toxic levels of dissolved metals and gases, and extreme reducing conditions are found across various Monument features. In spite of these conditions life not only exists, but thrives; albeit in forms that are uniquely suited for these specific locations.</p>

<h3>Management Plan</h3>
    <section class="home">
        <p>The Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA are working with the CNMI government, Department of Defense, Department of State, U.S. Coast Guard, and others to develop a monument management plan.</p>
        
        <p>The plan will provide for public education programs, traditional access by indigenous persons, scientific exploration and research, consideration of recreational fishing if it will not detract from the monument, and programs for monitoring and enforcement. A draft plan will be made available for public review and comment.</p>
