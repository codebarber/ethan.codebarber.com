<h2>My Career Goals</h2>

    <p class="para">My career goals are simple. I want to transfer from Diablo Valley College with a major in Graphic Design. I am taking this class because I heard that web design is fun and is closely related to graphic design. After college I would either like to find a job in graphic design or even web design if I see it as a possible career path for me. </p>
<h2>My Knowledge of Web Design</h2>
    <p class="para"> My knowledge of web design is very limited. This is the first class I am taking that involves writing code in Html and using Css. So far what I know is how to create headings with paragraphs at the simplest level. I am learning how to transfer files using Cyberduck. I am also learning how to create links that direct the visitors to different parts of my website.</p>
<h2>Hoping to Learn</h2>
    <p class="para">What I hope to learn from this class is how to create a well structured webpage. I want to learn Css and Html so that I can make a webpage that is easier to navigate and has links to other sites that are relevent to the topic of my webpage. For example I want to create a page to display my photography. While also having links to other photographers with a similar style or even some tutorials on how to setup your camera and taking pictures in manual settings on the same webpage under different links on my webpage.</p>
